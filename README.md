# Overview

This application is meant to demonstrate and practice my knowledge about the TypeScript language. It's a simple web browser drawing app. It gives the user a blank canvas. There is a clear button, an eraser button, and a color picker. The user can draw as much as they'd like and alter the canvas as much as they want. 

Below is a video of me demonstrating the application on my own computer.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to write this program in TypeScript and HTML. I was able to use the live server tool to test my program as the process went step by step. I have learned how to better use TyeScript and implement it into different programming applications.

# Future Work

Here are a couple of things I'd love to improve on in the future:

- Understand Jest and implement it into my future work.
- Incorporate a better user interface.
- Write better functions to help it run more efficiently.
